## O(n^2) Sorting Algorithms

Count the number of comparisons (selection vs bubble vs insertion)

* Best case comparison (pre sorted sequences)
* Worst case comparison (reverse sorted sequences)
* Average case comparison (random numbers)

## Shell sort optimization

Insertion sort vs shell sort with insertion sort as subroutine
- on pre sorted sequences
- reverse sorted sequnces
- random numbers

Insertion sort using different gaps (random numbers)
- Shell's gaps vs. Ciura's gaps

## Bucket sort optimization
- Bucket sort on different distributions (use insertion sort as subroutine)

## Radix sort optimization
Radix sort with counting sort as subroutine vs radix sort with insertion sort (this is a noncomparison sort, so count the number of element acceses in the sequence)
* pre sorted
* reverse sorted
* Random

## Merge sort vs Quick Sort
* Merge sort vs quick sort on random numbers
